## Next Steps
For next steps, I would like to add the option to like and comment on posts. In addition, I would like to have a feature where users can favorite posts. Lastly, I would like to have the option to search for certain resources, for example, recommendations for: anxiety, insomnia, etc.  
Currently, I also have one bug where users are unable to enter and update their social media links to their profile.
